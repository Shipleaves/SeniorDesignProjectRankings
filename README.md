To run this project, simply download and run Senior Design Project Ranking.exe which is available in the root directory. Source code is availble for inspection in MainWindow.xaml.cs.

This WPF project, written in C#, is intended to assist students rank the available projects for the Fall semester of COP 4934 Senior Design 1 at UCF, as well as collect data on the rankings to eventually create visualizations of which projects were the most sought after and which were not.

This application takes your indicated rankings and writes them to a text file for students to submit to the professor. It also sends an email to a temporary email address that I set up to collect anonymized rankings. The application does record your MAC address and sends it in the subject line of the email, to make it easier to detect duplicate submissions.
